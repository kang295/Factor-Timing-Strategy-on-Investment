# Factor Timing Project Overview ðŸ“ˆ

## Project Phases
1. **Variable Selection & Exploratory Analysis (EDA)**
   - Investigated Fama-French factors and macroeconomic variables for overvaluation or undervaluation.
   - Conducted preliminary linear regressions to identify significant predictors.

2. **Machine Learning Implementation**
   - Evaluated decision trees, random forests, and neural networks for factor timing prediction.
   - Compared model performances and selected random forests as the preferred method.

3. **Trading Signal & Strategy**
   - Implemented Random Forest Regressor for generating trading signals based on factor predictions.
   - Developed a Volatility Weighted combination factor strategy with stop-loss mechanism.

4. **Results & Analysis**
   - Analyzed Sharpe ratios, drawdowns, and transaction costs to evaluate strategy effectiveness.
   - Explored the implications of factor timing strategies on portfolio performance and risk management.

## Conclusion
The project findings highlight the complexities and challenges of factor timing strategies, emphasizing the need for cautious optimism and further research in the field. While certain strategies show theoretical promise, their practical application remains nuanced, with factors such as transaction costs and model limitations impacting overall performance.
